# Shapley Feature Engineering
Failed experiment to create features from using different statistical details of shapley values. See the notebook. 

The additional features help sometimes, but give 0.5-2% improvement. I don't think that is good enough to warrant the creation of a package. You can play around with it, the notebook is google colab compatible.
